# The Doppler Effect

1. The star’s (1) colour should change based on the value of the velocity input (2), where:
    a. 0 = no colour change
    b. ‐100 = Blue
    c. 100 = Red
2. The slider (3) should update the velocity input (2), in the range ‐100 to 100 inclusive.
3. The velocity input should accept numbers only; which are limited to range of the slider (3).
4. The slider should be based on either a log or exponential scale, providing more detail towards the negative velocity range (Blue).
